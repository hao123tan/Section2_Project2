# Section2_Project2
A listing of each accidental death associated with drug overdose in Connecticut from 2012 to 2018. A "Y" value under the different substance columns indicates that particular substance was detected.

Data are derived from an investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner which includes the toxicity report, death certificate, as well as a scene investigation.

In this project, I analyze three question. 
First, shows the 10 cities with the highest number of deaths caused by drugs, the 10 cities with the most injuries caused by drugs, and the 10 cities where the most drug users live, And determine which city is most affected by drug users.

Second, Show the age distribution of drug users killed by drugs, and determine which age group has the most deaths.

Third, Compare the number of heroin, cocaine, and oxycodone smokers to determine which drug consumes the most.
